🧩 Proyecto_Jhashua-Canton — LogicCircuit Project
This is a digital logic design project created with LogicCircuit (by Carl Burch). It defines multiple interconnected modules for a system that likely includes display handling, control logic, and visualization of revolutions or system states.

📁 Project Structure
The .logicCircuit file is an XML-based project containing multiple sub-circuits:

🔷 Logical Circuits Included:
Circuit Name	Description (inferred)
Principal	Main control or coordination circuit.
Main	Top-level circuit marked as the project entry.
Revoluciones	Displays or manages "Revolutions" or state changes.
Display	Manages binary-to-visual output representation.

These circuits are logically grouped under categories, including at least one named Sumadores (Adders), indicating arithmetic or counting logic is present.

🚀 How to Open and Use
Open LogicCircuit.

Go to File → Open Project.

Select Proyecto_Jhashua-Canton.CircuitProject.

Navigate between subcircuits using the project explorer.

Simulate using the play (▶️) button and interact with inputs.

⚙️ Possible Functionalities (Based on Circuit Names)
Principal: May coordinate input/output across all subsystems.

Main: Likely acts as the starting or wrapper module.

Revoluciones: Could simulate revolution counting or iteration (e.g., for motors, timers).

Display: Displays output values, possibly binary or hexadecimal.
